# ðŸŒŒ Exoplanet Detection and Explainability System

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting exoplanet transit events using light curve data from missions like NASA Kepler and TESS. It includes model training, inference APIs, a web dashboard, and natural language summaries and literature search to enhance explainability and accessibility.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Detect exoplanet transit events from raw light curve data
- Deploy a CNN or Transformer model with high accuracy
- Provide natural language explanations of predictions
- Search for similar patterns in arXiv scientific literature
- (Bonus) Filter false positives and support few-shot learning
